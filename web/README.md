1) Set one intelli-j run configuration to point to `http://localhost:8080`()
and an other one called 'test' to 8181

    run in terminal (within ./web)

    `pub get`

    (not sure) Build once with the pubspec.yaml top option

2) Run in terminal 

    `pub run build_runner serve`

    and leave it running..

3) it will hot reload on saved changes

4) eventually start a debug session with the intelli-j debug icon
